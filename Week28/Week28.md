Q1. Topic(1.2.13): There are several types of designs of mobile devices. Ones that provide better usability than others. The usability problem that I have personally encountered before was the old type of design consisting of physical buttons that most times would create a difficulty in typing. For example, the keys of the blackberry phones are usually very small and difficult to click and on  the old design of Nokia phones, one key represented more than one character which required repeated clicks to access all of the characters and missing one would mean having to click repeatedly again to find it which can be difficult for people to get used to.
