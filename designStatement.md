to me, Ruben

Dear Lauric√©nia,

Currently, I have all of my clothes stored under my bed here at ISAK. 
However, with the residential living that we have here, my clothes sometimes can get easily lost or moved around. 
My clothes constantly moves between different areas on campus such as my campus, the shower room, the washing machine, drying racks, other houses, or to Asama and KAC. 
Because of this, it has been easy for me (especially with socks) to lose track of my clothes; over the last semester, I've noticed my clothes dwindling as some of them disappear. 

As such, I need a program which would be able to help me keep track of where my clothes is -- I would want to be able to, for example, see if my clothes was in the wash or if it was just clean and folded in my closet. 
I'd also want it to only be accessible by me; however, security isn't a vital aspect for me. Lastly, the main way I differentiate between my clothes is what they are (shirt, pants, shirts, etc.), their brand, and their color. 

Best,
Rikio

=====================
My client requested for a clothes inventory software application. The Software will record all clothes owned by my client and will help the client to keep track of the location of the clothes. The thre main categories for the inventory (location) is based state of the clothes : if they are dirty/to be washed (in the laundry basket), being washed(in the washing machine) or clean(in the closet).
The client will be able to tick one of these categories in the list of clothes that will be divided into type (t-shirt,pants,etc), colour and brand.
