#Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).

#convert input and store
N = int(input())

#calculate hours(minutes passed divided by 60) and min(the remainder of the division)
Hours = N // 60
Min = N % 60

#print
print(Hours,Min)
