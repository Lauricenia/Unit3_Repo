#The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first cell, and then the last two - for the second cell. The program should output YES if a rook can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.

#get input
r1 = int(input())
c1 = int(input())
r2 = int(input())
c2 = int(input())

#if one of the pairs of rows or column is equal, then yes
if a == c or b == d:
