#There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost. Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.
Given a number N, followed by N âˆ’ 1 integers - representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N). Find and print the number on the lost card.

N sum_cards = 0

for i in range(0, n):
    sum_cards += i

for i in range(N - 1):
    sum_cards -= int(input())

print(sum_cards)
