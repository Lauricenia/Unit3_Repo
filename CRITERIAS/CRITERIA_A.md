definition of the problem:
---------
My client, Rikio Dahlgren, is a student of a boarding high school. As he is in a residential living, his clothes often get lost or moved around by other people and he easily loses track of them, having already lost some pieces. As such, he requested for a program which can help him keep track of the last location of his clothes. He wants the program to differentiate the clothes by type, brand and colour (see Appendix: Email with Client statement).




proposed solution: 
-----------------
To solve my client's issue, I decided to make an inventory for his clothes. The inventory project is a program based application. The main technologies associated with the program are Python, Qt designer and a laptop, each of these tecnologies are freely available and it's technical skills are managable. Python is the programming language that we are currently learning in class, it is object oriented and allows the development of applications. It also contains numerous third-party modules that make it capable of interacting with most of the other languages and platforms, in this case the Qt designer. Python also provides a large standard library which reduces length of code to be written significantly making the coding easier and has a rich internet resource bank .[1] Qt designer allows the design of the interface with simple and eay to understand tools and is also object-oriented. GUI module?
The inventory will be based on a computer program that allows my client to record his clothes, each with their distinct description and also the location of these clothes. The only editable part will be the location section, which is the essencial part of the system. The moment the user records a piece of cloth, all the clothes will be set to the default location set by the owner and so to avoid complications is better that all the clothes are really in that location. The default location allows the program to alarm the user if the current location has not been changed back to the default location for a period of time set by the user. Each time the user enters a new location, it is added to the history and is shown as a list everytime the user wants to change the location of a cloth. The description of the clothes will be done by type, brand and colour as asked by the client, this description will allow the client to differentiate the clothes but also the program. 


Criteria for success:
--------------

These are the measurable outcomes based on the 2nd interaction in the appendix : Clients approval of success of criteria.
1. The program shows the last location of the piece of clothes
1. The program allows the user to get location of the clothes by inputting in a search bar cloth piece description
1. The program allows the user to insert new clothes 
1. The program gives a alert to the user when the clothes are not in the room for a long time
