definition of the problem:
---------
My client, Rikio Dahlgren, is a student of a boarding high school. As he is in a residential living, his clothes often get lost or moved around by other people and he easily loses track of them, having already lost some pieces. As such, he requested for a program which can help him keep track of the last location of his clothes. He wants the program to differentiate the clothes by type, brand and colour (see Appendix: Email with Client statement).


proposed solution: 
-----------------
To solve my client's issue, I will develop an inventory for his clothes. The inventory will allow my client to record his clothes, each with their distinct description and also the location of these clothes. The only editable part will be the location section, which is the essencial part of the system. The moment the user records a piece of cloth, all the clothes will appear in a table with its description and will be set to the default location chosen by the client. To avoid complications all the clothes must really be placed in the default location. The default location allows the program to warn the user if the current location has not been changed back to it for a period of time of 24 hours. Each time the user enters a new location, it is added to the recently changed list which will be shown in one of the pages of the program to allow an easy reupdate of the location. The description of the clothes will be divided into type, brand and colour as asked by the client, this description will allow the client to differentiate the clothes recorded on the program. 

The inventory is a program based application. The main technologies associated with the program are Python, Qt designer and a laptop, each of these tecnologies are freely available and their technical skills are managable. Python and Qt are both object-oriented, have a rich internet resource bank, and allow the development and building of graphical user interface GUI based desktop applications. Python is the programming language that we are currently learning in class and its interaction with Qt creator is a practical way of understanding classes. Python v2 and v3 has a set called PyQt able to generate Python code from Qt Designer, that also allows to add new GUI controls written in Python to Qt Designer[2]. 


Criteria for success:
--------------

These are the measurable outcomes based on the 2nd interaction in the appendix : Clients approval of success of criteria.
1. The program shows the last location of the piece of clothes
1. The program allows the user to get location of the clothes by inputting in a search bar cloth piece description
1. The program allows the user to insert new clothes 
1. The program gives a alert to the user when the clothes are not in the room for a long time
