Criteria for success:
--------------

These are the measurable outcomes :
1. The program shows the last location of the piece of clothes
1. The program allows the user to get location of the clothes by inputting in a search bar cloth piece description
1. The program allows the user to insert new clothes 
1. The program gives a sign to the user when the clothes are not in the room for a long time 
1. Ask him if he wants a counter for the washing machine




definition of the problem:
---------
My client is a student of a boarding high school. As he is in a residential living, his clothes often get lost or moved around by other people and he easily loses track of them, having already lost some pieces. As such, he requested for a program which can help him keep track of the last location of his clothes. He wants the program to differentiate the clothes by type, brand and colour.  




proposed solution: 
-----------------
To solve my client's issue, I decided to make an inventory for his clothes. The inventory will be based on a computer program that allows my client to record his clothes, each with their distinct description and also the location of these clothes. The only editable part will be the location section, which is the essencial part of the system. The moment the user records a piece of cloth, all the clothes will be set to the default location set by the owner and so to avoid complications is better that all the clothes are really in that location. The default location allows the program to alarm the user if the current location has not been changed back to the default location for a period of time set by the user. Each time the user enters a new location, it is added to the history and is shown as a list everytime the user wants to change the location of a cloth. The description of the clothes will be done by type, brand and colour as asked by the client, this description will allow the client to differentiate the clothes but also the program.
