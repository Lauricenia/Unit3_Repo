This Fig.1 is a graphical representation of the system. From the image we can see that the input will be made by a keyboard and mouse and the output will be shown through a screen monitor. The app will consist of 4 user interfaces which will be described below. The arrows show the interaction between the user interface (one user interface allows the access to another).
